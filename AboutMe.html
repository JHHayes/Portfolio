     <p>My name is <strong> Joshua Hayes </strong> and I am a 25 year old Independent Graphic Designer. I was born in Worcester, MA and have lived in the neigboring town of Auburn my entire life. Some fun facts about me are that I have been to three colleges, one being Mount Ida during the time of its untimely closing,then Quinsigamond Community College and now Lesley University. I have a history in psychology, mainly human behavior, and I am Jewish!
    I have an extensive work history, many have been working in Print Shops where i was tasked with creating stationary print projects for people and working on print making machines. I have also done many summers working for the housing group called OpenSky where I do whatever they need but usually help them scan in old documents and organize their systems. During quarentine i did some time as a janitor in a warehouse where I cleaned every surface down all night to make sure everything was extra clean and safe. Now I try to sell myself as an independent graphic designer. I genuinely enjoy working in print shops and as a graphic designer and I will always be happy to take any excuse to make something on stationary or using the print making process. Most of my experience in the field has been in the worcester-boston area. A quick mention of my many volunteer work I feel helped shape me the most were working with the turtle rescue league, where I helped identify locations where turtles frequently cross the road or live in places where they are in danger and as a response to that make signs telling people turtles cross there and on some occassions physccially go out and catch turtles then relocate and release them at better locations where they can live better lives,  and IHN which is a support for homeless people who help offer short term temporary living while they sort something else out.
