     My name is <strong> Joshua Hayes </strong> and I am a 25 year old Independent Graphic Designer.  
    I have a history working in Print Shops creating stationary print projects for people and working on print making machines as well as an independent graphic designer; I genuinely enjoy doing this as such I will always be happy to take any excuse to make something on stationary or using the print making process. Most of my experience in the field has been in the worcester-boston area.
