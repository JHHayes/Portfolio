        <h1> About me</h1>
            <p> My name is <strong> Joshua Hayes </strong> and I am a student at Lesley University going for my BFA in Graphic Design and I am a 24 year old male born and raised in Massachusetts.<br>
             I have a history working in Print Shops creating stationary print making projects for people and working on print making machines, I genuinely enjoy doing this as such I will always be happy to take any excuse to make something on stationary or using the print making process. Most of my experience in the field has been in the worcester-boston area.<br>
            Things to know about me that will probably see in my work is that I am a caring and empathetic person who will jump at any opportunity to help others, even if its just making them smile with a silly jest. I am also avid nature lover and have a tendency to lean towards story telling.<br>
