    <h1> About me</h1>
        <p> My name is <strong> Joshua Hayes </strong> and I am a 24 year old student going for my BFA in Graphic Design at Lesley University.  
         I have a history working in Print Shops creating stationary print projects for people and working on print making machines as well as an independent graphic designer; I genuinely enjoy doing this as such I will always be happy to take any excuse to make something on stationary or using the print making process. Most of my experience in the field has been in the worcester-boston area.
        Things to know about me that will probably see in my work is that I am a caring and empathetic person who will jump at opportunities to help others, even if its just making them smile with a silly jest. I am also avid nature lover and have a tendency to lean towards story telling.
